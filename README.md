Create Azure AD User
====================

            

Use this Automation Runbook to create Azure AD Users in a really easy way. The runbook relies on the Msonline PowerShell modules which needs to be imported as Automation assets before you can execute the runbook.


See my blog post at [http://bit.ly/1SNsgA6](http://blog.orneling.se/2015/11/import-new-modules-into-azure-automation/) for more information on how to import these modules into Azure Automation.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
